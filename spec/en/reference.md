## GTFS-ride

**Current version published `September 6, 2017`. See [Revision History](../../CHANGES.md) for more details.**

This document explains the types of files that comprise a GTFS-ride dataset and defines the fields used in all of those files. The bolded files are those unique to GTFS-ride. They are not included in standard GTFS.

## Term Definitions

>This section defines terms that are used throughout this document.
>
>* **Field required** - The field column must be included in your feed, and a value must be provided for each record. Some required fields permit an empty string as a value. To enter an empty string, just omit any text between the commas for that field. Note that 0 is interpreted as "a string of value 0", and is not an empty string. Please see the field definition for details.
>* **Field optional** - The field column may be omitted from your feed. If you choose to include an optional column, each record in your feed must have a value for that column. You may include an empty string as a value for records that do not have values for the column. Some optional fields permit an empty string as a value. To enter an empty string, just omit any text between the commas for that field. Note that 0 is interpreted as "a string of value 0", and is not an empty string.
>* **Dataset unique** - The field contains a value that maps to a single distinct entity within the column. For example, if a route is assigned the ID **1A**, then no other route may use that route ID. However, you may assign the ID **1A** to a location because locations are a different type of entity than routes.

## Feed Files

This specification includes the following files along with their associated content. **Bolded** files are unique to GTFS-ride, while the rest reference GTFS files. GTFS-ride follows, and by default adopts, changes in GTFS files already specified in GTFS-ride. If a new file is added to GTFS, its inclusion in GTFS-ride will follow the change process specified for any change to GTFS-ride. More information on the GTFS files may be found at [https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md).

## File Requirements

>The following requirements apply to the format and contents of your files:

>* All files in a General Transit Feed Spec (GTFS) feed must be saved as comma-delimited text.
>* The first line of each file must contain field names. Each subsection of the [Field Definitions](#field-definitions) section corresponds to one of the files in a transit feed and lists the field names you may use in that file.
>* All field names are case-sensitive.
>* Field values may not contain tabs, carriage returns or new lines.
>* Field values that contain quotation marks or commas must be enclosed within quotation marks. In addition, each quotation mark in the field value must be preceded with a quotation mark. This is consistent with the manner in which Microsoft Excel outputs comma-delimited (CSV) files. For more information on the CSV file format, see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.
>The following example demonstrates how a field value would appear in a comma-delimited file:
  * **Original field value:** `Contains "quotes", commas and text`
  * **Field value in CSV file:** `"Contains ""quotes"", commas and text"`
>* Field values must not contain HTML tags, comments or escape sequences.
>* Remove any extra spaces between fields or field names. Many parsers consider the spaces to be part of the value, which may cause errors.
>* Each line must end with a CRLF or LF linebreak character.
>* Files should be encoded in UTF-8 to support all Unicode characters. Files that include the Unicode byte-order mark (BOM) character are acceptable. Please see the [Unicode FAQ](http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#BOM) for more information on the BOM character and UTF-8.
>* Zip the files in your feed.
