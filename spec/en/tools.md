## Tools

### Testing Your GTFS-ride Dataset:

[feedvalidator_ride](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/transitfeed-ride) is available to validate GTFS-ride filesets. The tool functions in a similar manner as GTFS [feedvalidator tool](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/FeedValidator), but has been modified to additionally validate GTFS-ride files.
